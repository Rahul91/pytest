Kolkata, March 28 (IANS) Indian steel major Tata Steel on Saturday said it has produced ten million tonne per annum (MnTPA) of hot metal from a single plant location in Jamshedpur making it the first Indian firm to achieve the milestone.

"Starting from a capacity of only 0.16 nn TPA (A Blast Furnace) in 1911, the company today stands at 10 Mn TPA, accomplishing a growth of 63 times in terms of its production capacity," the company said in a statement.
The steel producer, which makes nearly 30 million tonnes crude steel annually undertook an upgradation project in its plant in 1992 to increase its steel production capacity.
"The modernisation journey in 1992 began with the commissioning of G Blast Furnace, which increased the rated capacity from 2.4 mn TPA to 3.15 mn TPA. The working volumes of C, D and E Blast Furnaces were also increased in the following years," the company said.
