FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) group sales fell for the first time in at least four and a half years in April, raising pressure on the German carmaker to fix trouble spots laid bare by the shock ouster of Chairman Ferdinand Piech.
Deliveries at the 12-brand group including luxury division Audi and sports-car maker Porsche slid 1.3 percent year-on-year to 853,200 cars, VW said on Friday.
