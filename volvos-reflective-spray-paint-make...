Washington, Mar 29 (ANI): The Swedish car manufacturer Volvo and UK design firm Grey London have partnered with Albedo100 to come up with a reflective spray-paint to make cycling safer at night.The LifePaint, which is technically not paint, is a washable material that lasts about 10 days after application and is completely invisible until it's hit by the glare of a car's headlights after which it glows, the Verge reported.Nick Connor, managing director at Volvo, said in a statement that every year more than 19,000 cyclists are injured on the UK's roads , adding that at Volvo, they believe that the best way to survive a crash is not to crash and are committed to making the roads a safer place by reducing the number of accidents.The water-based LifePaint, which can safely be applied to clothes, helmets, shoes, backpacks, and even dog leashes, is available in six cycling shops in Kent and London, and if it does well, Volvo may move the product internationally.
